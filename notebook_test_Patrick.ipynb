Disney are excellent with disability access and cater to all types of disabilities, both visible (wheelchair users, etc.) and invisible (autism, etc.), we managed to get on a lot of rides because with the pass you don't queue in the normal queue but the entrance for disabilities. I can only fault one thing when I went we met Spider man and had photos taken but you have to pay for the photos and they are very expensive, even to just pay for one photo. The food wasn't spectacular but it was edible and nice, there is a variety of food outlets so there was plenty of choice. I would loved to go again in Halloween or Christmas but if not I would just love to go again.",

Disney are excellent with disability access and cater to all types of disabilities, both visible (wheelchair users, etc.) and invisible (autism, etc.), we managed to get on a lot of rides because with the pass you don't queue in the normal queue but the entrance for disabilities. I can only fault one thing when I went we met Spider man and had photos taken but you have to pay for the photos and they are very expensive, even to just pay for one photo. The food wasn't spectacular but it was edible and nice, there is a variety of food outlets so there was plenty of choice. I would loved to go again in Halloween or Christmas but if not I would just love to go again.",
